# Waterfall Entry

Staggered ARRIVAL cascade: words/elements whip in from below (one consistent direction),
each starting before the previous settles — an accelerating wave that resolves into a
composed layout. Title cards, segment openers, list/feature intros.

**This is an in-scene arrival, not a seam.** Its seam sibling is the waterfall CUT
(`cut-the-curve` doctrine skill, `seams/waterfall-cut.md`); do not mix their rules:

|               | Entry (this rule — arrival)                   | Waterfall Cut (seam)                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Opacity       | BINARY 0→1 via `tl.set` at entry — never fade | ignites at 0.35 mid-path — the fade IS the velocity trick |
| Axis default  | Y, from below                                 | X, riding the current                                     |
| Outgoing side | none                                          | words ramp out on mirrored power4.in                      |

## Choreography

- **Overlap, don't queue** — next element starts within ±2 frames of the previous
  settling; gaps SHRINK across the cascade; the last element snaps.
- **Velocity varies by weight** — heavy/anchor elements travel further and longer;
  light words/punctuation snap in tight:

| Parameter | Anchor/heavy | Normal word | Light/punctuation |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Y offset  | 60–80px      | 40–50px     | 30–48px           |
| Duration  | 0.16–0.20s   | 0.13–0.16s  | 0.10–0.13s        |
| Overlap   | 0–2f gap     | 1f overlap  | 1–2f overlap      |

- Ease `power4.out` (`expo.out` for extra snap); never `.inOut` on an entry.
- One direction per cascade.
- Split the FINAL word into fragments to extend the climax; fragments travel further.
- Post-settle, the group usually slides to make room for the next beat — that's
  [nudge-curve.md](nudge-curve.md).

## JS

Each element: `tl.set` (instant reveal + offset) then `tl.to` (whip to rest).
`nextStart = prevStart + prevDuration − (overlapFrames × F)`; +overlap = cascade,
−overlap = deliberate gap. CSS: elements start `opacity: 0; display: inline-block`.

```js
var F = 1 / 60;
var t0 = 0.1;
// anchor (heaviest): biggest travel, longest settle
tl.set("#el-1", { opacity: 1, y: 80 }, t0);
tl.to("#el-1", { y: 0, duration: 0.18, ease: "power4.out" }, t0);
// normal word: 2 frames after the anchor finishes
var t1 = t0 + 0.18 + 2 * F;
tl.set("#el-2", { opacity: 1, y: 45 }, t1);
tl.to("#el-2", { y: 0, duration: 0.15, ease: "power4.out" }, t1);
// light word: 1 frame BEFORE the previous finishes (overlap)
var t2 = t1 + 0.15 - F;
tl.set("#el-3", { opacity: 1, y: 40 }, t2);
tl.to("#el-3", { y: 0, duration: 0.14, ease: "power4.out" }, t2);
// split final-word fragments: tightest overlap, extra travel (lighter)
var t3 = t2 + 0.14 - F;
tl.set("#frag-a", { opacity: 1, y: 70 }, t3);
tl.to("#frag-a", { y: 0, duration: 0.16, ease: "power4.out" }, t3);
var t4 = t3 + 0.14 - F;
tl.set("#frag-b", { opacity: 1, y: 70 }, t4);
tl.to("#frag-b", { y: 0, duration: 0.15, ease: "power4.out" }, t4);
// punctuation: lightest, fastest
var t5 = t4 + 0.13 - 2 * F;
tl.set("#dot", { opacity: 1, y: 48 }, t5);
tl.to("#dot", { y: 0, duration: 0.12, ease: "power4.out" }, t5);
```

## Anti-patterns

| Don't                                                  | Instead                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Queued entries (each waits for the previous to settle) | Overlap ±1–2 frames — the cascade is a wave, not a queue                          |
| Same offset/duration for every cascade element         | Vary by weight: anchors travel further, punctuation snaps                         |
| Gradual opacity fade on an arrival                     | Binary 0→1 via `tl.set` — fading fights the snap (seam cuts fade; arrivals don't) |

## Selected motion rule: anchored-layout-expand

name: anchored-layout-expand
description: Edge-pinned container grows (or collapses) along ONE axis and in-flow content reflows with it — a pill springs open downward into a dropdown, a panel grows a sub-task stack, an input card stretches as typed text wraps, a pane expands over a neighbor. Transform-only (mask + slide, or proxy-driven scaleY + counter-scale) because width/height tweens are forbidden; the push on subsequent content is a matched translate on the same tween.

# Anchored Layout Expand

> The law: **author the layout at its final (expanded) state in CSS, then fake the collapsed state with transforms.** The container never changes size — the _visible_ region does — and everything downstream rides a matched translate. The browser computes layout ONCE; every intermediate frame is pure transform.

THE one-axis growth primitive: a container pinned at one edge appears to grow along a single axis, and the in-flow content after it moves in perfect contact with the traveling edge — dropdown, sub-task stack, growing composer card, pane widening over a neighbor. Growth and push are ONE motion: if the panel's bottom edge and the pushed content ever separate or overlap, the illusion dies.

Distinct from [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (a free-floating two-shot morph with no neighbors to push — this rule's container is a live layout participant), [spring-pop-entrance.md](spring-pop-entrance.md) (arrival at a point, no edge travel or reflow), and [reactive-displacement.md](reactive-displacement.md) (displacement by a colliding intruder; here content moves because the container's edge reached it — layout causality, not collision).

## How It Works

1. **Mask** — a wrapper at the final body height (`BODY_H`), `overflow: hidden`. Never tweened.
2. **Sheet** — the panel surface + content inside the mask, starting at `y: -BODY_H` (tucked above the mask window, behind the pinned header).
3. **Below** — ONE wrapper holding everything after the container, also starting at `y: -BODY_H`.
4. **Grow** — ONE `fromTo` drives sheet AND below from `y: -BODY_H → 0`. Shared tween ⇒ the descending bottom edge and the pushed content stay in exact contact by construction. Collapse = the same pair tweened back.

When the surface must visibly **stretch in place** (rows revealed top-first, or a pane growing sideways), use the proxy counter-scale variant below instead.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="stack">
  <div class="expander">
    <div class="expander-head">{headerLabel}</div>
    <div class="expand-mask" id="expand-mask" data-layout-allow-overflow>
      <div class="expand-sheet" id="expand-sheet">
        <div class="expand-row">{rowA}</div>
        <div class="expand-row">{rowB}</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- EVERYTHING that must be pushed lives in this one wrapper -->
  <div class="below" id="below">{followingContent}</div>
</div>
```

```css
/* Layout is the EXPANDED end state — no collapsed geometry exists in CSS. */
.expander-head {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2; /* the sheet slides out from UNDER the header */
}
.expand-mask {
  height: BODY_H; /* authored final height — NEVER tweened */
  overflow: hidden;
}
.expand-sheet {
  height: BODY_H;
  border-radius: 0 0 SHEET_RADIUS SHEET_RADIUS; /* bottom-only — header + sheet read as one grown card */
  will-change: transform; /* + on .below */
}
```

```js
// BODY_H must equal the mask's CSS height exactly — measure once at build.
// (Montage caveat: per the contract, in a multi-scene master use an authored
// CSS-matched constant instead — later clips may not be laid out yet.)
const BODY_H = document.querySelector("#expand-mask").offsetHeight;

// The grow: ONE tween, BOTH sides of the seam.
tl.fromTo(
  ["#expand-sheet", "#below"],
  { y: -BODY_H },
  { y: 0, duration: GROW_DUR, ease: GROW_EASE },
  GROW_AT,
);

// Garnish: rows already ride the sheet; the fade stagger makes them read as "options arriving".
tl.fromTo(
  ".expand-row",
  { opacity: 0 },
  { opacity: 1, duration: ROW_FADE_DUR, stagger: ROW_STAGGER, ease: "power2.out" },
  GROW_AT + GROW_DUR * 0.25,
);

// Collapse — same machinery back; faster (closing is a snap decision).
tl.fromTo(
  ["#expand-sheet", "#below"],
  { y: 0 },
  { y: -BODY_H, duration: COLLAPSE_DUR, ease: "power3.in", immediateRender: false },
  COLLAPSE_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Proxy counter-scale — surface stretches in place** (rows revealed top-first holding their screen positions; the "payload card expands from the tool-call line"). Drive mask `scaleY` and the sheet's exact inverse from ONE proxy — two independent tweens are wrong: eased midpoints of `s` and `1/s` are not inverses and the content squashes mid-grow. Net content scale is `s × 1/s = 1` every frame; seek-safe because everything derives from the one interpolated proxy.

  ```js
  const grow = { h: COLLAPSED_H }; // 0 for fully collapsed
  tl.fromTo(
    grow,
    { h: COLLAPSED_H },
    {
      h: BODY_H,
      duration: GROW_DUR,
      ease: GROW_EASE,
      onUpdate: () => {
        const s = Math.max(grow.h / BODY_H, 0.0001); // clamp: no divide-by-zero
        gsap.set("#expand-mask", { scaleY: s, transformOrigin: "50% 0%" });
        gsap.set("#expand-sheet", { scaleY: 1 / s, transformOrigin: "50% 0%" });
        gsap.set("#below", { y: grow.h - BODY_H });
      },
    },
    GROW_AT,
  );
  ```

- **One-axis pane expand (X)**: same machinery rotated 90° — pin the left edge, sheet from `x: -PANE_W` (or proxy `scaleX` + counter-scale, origin `0% 50%`). Decide the neighbor's fate explicitly: **overlap** (pane paints over it, no neighbor tween) or **push** (neighbor rides the same tween). Never both.
- **Typed-wrap growth** — the composer card gets taller as typed text wraps. Quantize: one short step per wrap boundary, each moving the pair by one `LINE_H`; wrap times come from the deterministic typing schedule ([discrete-text-sequence.md](discrete-text-sequence.md)), never measured at render time. Two battle-tested traps:
  - **Composer cards have no pinned header** — a composer grows from its TOP edge (the send-button footer stays put), so a plain y-step clips the card's top out of the mask. Combine the proxy counter-scale with the wrap quantization (step the proxy by `LINE_H` at each wrap time) and split the surface into a **sheet** (carries the top radius) + **footer** (carries the bottom radius) so the growth seam stays invisible.
  - **Wrap TIME vs wrap POSITION are two different authorities** — the typing schedule decides _when_ a wrap fires, the browser's line-breaking decides _where_ text actually wraps, and with proportional fonts they silently disagree. Author an explicit `\n` in the typed string (with `white-space: pre-wrap`) at the chosen split point so both derive from the same authored fact.
- **Springy open** (rare, explicitly-playful): `back.out(1.2)` — the edge overshoots a few px; the pushed content bounces with the panel (correct — they're in contact). Default stays `power3.out`.
- **Row grows a sub-task stack**: the row is the pinned header, the stack is the sheet, every later row lives in `#below`; chain several scopes for progressive disclosure.
- **FLIP hand-off**: if the container also TRAVELS to a new layout slot while resizing (prompt promoted to heading, card docking into a sidebar), that's a FLIP problem — `/hyperframes-keyframes` (FLIP recipes). This rule stays the in-place one-axis specialist.

| GROW_DUR                 | 0.35–0.6s                   | below ~0.3s the pushed content appears to teleport                    |
| GROW_EASE                | `power3.out` default        | `back.out(1.1–1.3)` only for the playful register                     |
| ROW_STAGGER / \_FADE_DUR | 0.04–0.08s / 0.2–0.3s       | start rows ~25% into the grow so none flash inside a closed panel     |
| COLLAPSE_DUR             | 0.2–0.35s, `power3.in`      | faster than open                                                      |
| STEP_DUR / LINE_H        | 0.12–0.2s / CSS line-height | typed-wrap variant; WRAP_TIMES from the typing script                 |

## Critical Constraints

- **NEVER tween `width` / `height` / `top` / `left` / `margin` / `padding`** — the mask's height is a CSS constant; only its children transform. Tweening the mask IS the forbidden move this rule replaces.
- **`data-layout-allow-overflow` on the mask** — the collapsed phase parks the sheet outside the mask's box by construction, which trips the `hyperframes check` layout gate (`container_overflow`). The flag is the sanctioned waiver: this overflow is the technique working as designed, not a bug.
- **Sheet + below share one tween (or one proxy)** — matched-but-separate tweens on the two sides of the contact edge are the classic seam bug.
- **Everything downstream rides `#below`** — content outside the wrapper is overlapped at t=0 and orphaned during the grow.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the mask** — without it the tucked sheet is visible above the header at t=0.
- **Counter-scale needs a proxy**, clamped `s ≥ 0.0001` (a fully-collapsed body divides by zero).
- **Deterministic sizes** — `BODY_H`, `LINE_H`, `WRAP_TIMES` are build-time constants or one-time measurements, never per-frame layout reads.

# SVG Icon Enrichment

Treats an SVG icon as a composition of animated PARTS, not an opaque image. Each meaningful internal element (a clock hand, scissor blade, recording dot, data line) gets its own micro-animation, targeted by id. Distinct from [svg-path-draw](svg-path-draw.md) (which animates the OUTLINE drawing) — enrichment animates INTERNAL PARTS, ideally after the outline has drawn.

Four signature patterns:

| Pattern     | Use For                            | Math                                  | Tip                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Rotation    | Clock, gear, loader, dial          | `rotate(deg cx cy)` attribute, linear | see the transform-center gotcha    |
| Oscillation | Scissors, wings, toggle            | `rotate(±sin·amp)` on opposing groups | opposite signs on the two parts    |
| Pulse       | Recording dot, heart, notification | `scale(1 + sin·amp)` + opacity        | ring lags dot by π/2 for ripple    |
| Dash flow   | Cutting line, data stream          | `strokeDashoffset` linear via time    | negative for L→R, positive for R→L |

## ❗ The transform-center gotcha

**For rotation around an explicit point inside an SVG, use the SVG `transform` ATTRIBUTE, not CSS transform**: `el.setAttribute("transform", `rotate(${deg} ${cx} ${cy})`)`. The CSS combination `transform: rotate(...)` + `transform-origin: 60px 60px` + `transform-box: fill-box` interprets the origin in the element's OWN **bbox-local** coordinates, NOT viewBox coordinates. For a thin `<line>` (whose bbox is the line's narrow envelope), `60 60` bbox-local is a point OUTSIDE the line — the hand flies along an off-center arc instead of rotating in place. Same trap for small inner shapes (a dot circle whose bbox is the small circle, not the full viewBox).

**Scaling around a center point**: same attribute route — `el.setAttribute("transform", `translate(${cx} ${cy}) scale(${s}) translate(-${cx} -${cy})`)`.

      dot.setAttribute("transform", `translate(60 60) scale(${sD}) translate(-60 -60)`);

      );
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Pattern 4 — Dash flow. Linear offset tween on a dashed stroke.
const flowState = { offset: 0 };
tl.to(
  flowState,
  {
    offset: DASH_FLOW_TOTAL_OFFSET, // negative = L→R
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,

    onUpdate: () => {
      document.getElementById("data-flow").style.strokeDashoffset = String(flowState.offset);
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Stroke draw → enrichment chain** — draw the outline first via [svg-path-draw](svg-path-draw.md) (phase 1, `0 → OUTLINE_DUR`), then start enrichment at `OUTLINE_DUR`: the icon "wakes up" after assembly.
- **Per-icon entry stagger** — for a row of icons, each icon's enrichment starts as it fades in, not synchronized.

| DASH_FLOW_TOTAL_OFFSET          | ±100–400             | must be an integer multiple of the dash period (dash + gap) or the end frame shows a phase jump |

## Critical Constraints

- **The transform-center gotcha above** — SVG `transform` attribute for any rotation/scale around an explicit interior point; never CSS `transform-origin` + `transform-box: fill-box` on thin lines or small inner shapes.
- **No `requestAnimationFrame`** — like CSS animation, it desyncs from HF's frame-by-frame seek; continuous motion lives inside the timeline as linear proxy tweens.
- **Amplitudes subtle** — icons are decorative, not headlines; calibrate rotation speed against composition length, not absolute time.
- **Phase-offset the parts** — minute vs second hand at different speeds, ring lagging dot by π/2. Pure sync looks mechanical.
- **`stroke-linecap: round`** on flowing/dashed lines for clean dash edges.
- **Climax dwell ≥1s** — if the enrichment is the headline beat, the composition continues ≥1s after the most dramatic moment.
