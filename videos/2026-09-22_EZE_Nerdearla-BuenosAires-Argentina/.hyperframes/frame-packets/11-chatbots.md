# Waterfall Entry

Staggered ARRIVAL cascade: words/elements whip in from below (one consistent direction),
each starting before the previous settles — an accelerating wave that resolves into a
composed layout. Title cards, segment openers, list/feature intros.

**This is an in-scene arrival, not a seam.** Its seam sibling is the waterfall CUT
(`cut-the-curve` doctrine skill, `seams/waterfall-cut.md`); do not mix their rules:

|               | Entry (this rule — arrival)                   | Waterfall Cut (seam)                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Opacity       | BINARY 0→1 via `tl.set` at entry — never fade | ignites at 0.35 mid-path — the fade IS the velocity trick |
| Axis default  | Y, from below                                 | X, riding the current                                     |
| Outgoing side | none                                          | words ramp out on mirrored power4.in                      |

## Choreography

- **Overlap, don't queue** — next element starts within ±2 frames of the previous
  settling; gaps SHRINK across the cascade; the last element snaps.
- **Velocity varies by weight** — heavy/anchor elements travel further and longer;
  light words/punctuation snap in tight:

| Parameter | Anchor/heavy | Normal word | Light/punctuation |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Y offset  | 60–80px      | 40–50px     | 30–48px           |
| Duration  | 0.16–0.20s   | 0.13–0.16s  | 0.10–0.13s        |
| Overlap   | 0–2f gap     | 1f overlap  | 1–2f overlap      |

- Ease `power4.out` (`expo.out` for extra snap); never `.inOut` on an entry.
- One direction per cascade.
- Split the FINAL word into fragments to extend the climax; fragments travel further.
- Post-settle, the group usually slides to make room for the next beat — that's
  [nudge-curve.md](nudge-curve.md).

## JS

Each element: `tl.set` (instant reveal + offset) then `tl.to` (whip to rest).
`nextStart = prevStart + prevDuration − (overlapFrames × F)`; +overlap = cascade,
−overlap = deliberate gap. CSS: elements start `opacity: 0; display: inline-block`.

```js
var F = 1 / 60;
var t0 = 0.1;
// anchor (heaviest): biggest travel, longest settle
tl.set("#el-1", { opacity: 1, y: 80 }, t0);
tl.to("#el-1", { y: 0, duration: 0.18, ease: "power4.out" }, t0);
// normal word: 2 frames after the anchor finishes
var t1 = t0 + 0.18 + 2 * F;
tl.set("#el-2", { opacity: 1, y: 45 }, t1);
tl.to("#el-2", { y: 0, duration: 0.15, ease: "power4.out" }, t1);
// light word: 1 frame BEFORE the previous finishes (overlap)
var t2 = t1 + 0.15 - F;
tl.set("#el-3", { opacity: 1, y: 40 }, t2);
tl.to("#el-3", { y: 0, duration: 0.14, ease: "power4.out" }, t2);
// split final-word fragments: tightest overlap, extra travel (lighter)
var t3 = t2 + 0.14 - F;
tl.set("#frag-a", { opacity: 1, y: 70 }, t3);
tl.to("#frag-a", { y: 0, duration: 0.16, ease: "power4.out" }, t3);
var t4 = t3 + 0.14 - F;
tl.set("#frag-b", { opacity: 1, y: 70 }, t4);
tl.to("#frag-b", { y: 0, duration: 0.15, ease: "power4.out" }, t4);
// punctuation: lightest, fastest
var t5 = t4 + 0.13 - 2 * F;
tl.set("#dot", { opacity: 1, y: 48 }, t5);
tl.to("#dot", { y: 0, duration: 0.12, ease: "power4.out" }, t5);
```

## Anti-patterns

| Don't                                                  | Instead                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Queued entries (each waits for the previous to settle) | Overlap ±1–2 frames — the cascade is a wave, not a queue                          |
| Same offset/duration for every cascade element         | Vary by weight: anchors travel further, punctuation snaps                         |
| Gradual opacity fade on an arrival                     | Binary 0→1 via `tl.set` — fading fights the snap (seam cuts fade; arrivals don't) |

description: Avatars distributed on an elliptical ring connected by SVG dashed lines to a center hub — social proof "community" reveal with staggered entry.

# Avatar Cloud Network

Avatars on an elliptical ring around a central hub (logo / counter), with SVG dashed lines drawing outward from the hub to each avatar — "community" / social proof. Distinct from [orbit-3d-entry.md](orbit-3d-entry.md) (continuous orbit): this settles into a static composed formation.

## How It Works

Three layers: SVG lines (z-index 1, behind), avatars (z-index 2), hub (z-index 5 — lines terminate AT its edge, never pass through). Avatar positions and lines are built once at setup from ONE shared center; the timeline then runs hub fade → avatar cascade → outward line draw → breathing dwell. Drawing FROM the center is the narrative: "the hub connects to its community."

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<svg class="lines" viewBox="0 0 1920 1080"><!-- lines injected --></svg>
<div class="hub-wrap">
  <div class="hub">{counterValue} {counterLabel}</div>
  <!-- avatars injected -->
</div>
```

```css
.lines {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  z-index: 1;
  pointer-events: none;
}
.hub-wrap {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.hub {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 5;
}
.avatar {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 2;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%); /* centers on the (left, top) the script sets */
  will-change: transform, opacity;
}
```

```js
// CENTER_X/Y must equal the hub's RENDERED center exactly — every avatar
// position and line endpoint derives from it. For a place-items:center hub on
// a 1920×1080 canvas: (W/2, H × CENTER_Y_FACTOR).
const C = { x: CENTER_X, y: CENTER_Y };
const wrap = document.querySelector(".hub-wrap");
const svg = document.querySelector(".lines");

for (let i = 0; i < AVATAR_COUNT; i++) {
  const a = (i / AVATAR_COUNT) * Math.PI * 2 - Math.PI / 2; // start at top
  const x = C.x + Math.cos(a) * RADIUS_X;
  const y = C.y + Math.sin(a) * RADIUS_Y;

  const av = document.createElement("div");
  av.className = "avatar"; // assign image / glyph from authoring data
  av.style.left = `${x}px`;
  av.style.top = `${y}px`;
  wrap.appendChild(av);

  const line = document.createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg", "line");
  const attrs = {
    x1: C.x,
    y1: C.y,
    x2: x,
    y2: y,
    stroke: "{lineColor}",
    "stroke-dasharray": "6 8",
  };
  Object.entries(attrs).forEach(([k, v]) => line.setAttribute(k, String(v)));
  const len = Math.hypot(x - C.x, y - C.y); // straight line — Math.hypot, not getTotalLength()
  line.style.strokeDashoffset = String(len);
  svg.appendChild(line);
}

tl.from(".hub", { opacity: 0, scale: 0.8, duration: HUB_DUR, ease: `back.out(${HUB_BOUNCE})` }, 0);

const avatars = document.querySelectorAll(".avatar");
avatars.forEach((av, i) => {
  tl.from(
    av,
    { opacity: 0, scale: 0, duration: AVATAR_DUR, ease: `back.out(${AVATAR_BOUNCE})` },
    AVATAR_AT + i * AVATAR_STAGGER,
  );
});
svg.querySelectorAll("line").forEach((line, i) => {
  tl.to(
    line,
    { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: LINE_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
    LINES_AT + i * LINE_STAGGER,
  );
});

// Climax dwell — out-of-phase breathing holds the eye on the formed network:
// one phase proxy (0 → 2π·BREATH_CYCLES, ease "none"); onUpdate scales avatar i by
// 1 + sin(p + (i/n)·2π) · BREATH_AMP — sine-wave-loop's multiplicative onUpdate form.
// Keep the -50% centering in the same transform write.
```

## Variations

- **Size variety**: vary avatar sizes by a small index-keyed array so the ring doesn't read rigidly repetitive.
- **Solid lines**: drop the dash + draw; lines fade in via opacity — more corporate, less networky.
- **Multi-orbit**: inner ring (fewer, larger) connected to the hub; outer ring is an unconnected "halo."
- **Glyph avatars**: flags / emoji / icons instead of faces — reads "global community" or role spread.

| BREATH_CYCLES  | 1.0–2.0 over the remaining s | under 1 = single sigh; over 2 = anxious. BREATH_AMP 0.02–0.06    |

Tokens: dark `{bgColor}` so the cloud reads as a constellation; translucent accent `{lineColor}`; soft border + glow keeps avatars legible on dark.

## Critical Constraints

- **CENTER_X/Y must match the hub's actual rendered center** — when composed with another scene (e.g. a recentered logo), bake them from the same source as the hub's final position, or lines visibly miss the hub.
- **Hub z-index above lines** — lines terminate at the hub edge, never cross it.
- **Lines draw outward** (dashoffset len → 0), starting after avatars are mostly settled.
- **`RADIUS_X > RADIUS_Y`** — a horizontal ellipse reads as perspective; a circle reads flat.
- **Climax dwell ≥ 1s** after lines complete so the formed network is readable.
- Straight lines: `Math.hypot` for length — `getTotalLength()` not needed.

# Control-Target Sync

THE live-editing move: an inspector/editor control is manipulated — a value scrubbed, a field retyped, a dropdown picked — and a **bound second element answers in the same frame**. The button rotates WHILE the rotation value scrubs; icons resize PER KEYSTROKE. The persuasion is causality — one gesture, two surfaces changing together — and this rule is the coupling contract that produces it.

Nearest precedent is [reactive-displacement.md](reactive-displacement.md): that rule also derives two elements' motion from one source, but it is **collision physics** — an entering intruder displaces an exiting victim, once, as a transition, and the victim leaves. This rule is a **live editing mirror**: the control is manipulated repeatedly across several beats, the target answers every time, and both sides hold the stage throughout. The numeric readout rides [counting-dynamic-scale.md](counting-dynamic-scale.md)'s proxy pattern; discrete steps ride [discrete-text-sequence.md](discrete-text-sequence.md)'s threshold pattern — what this rule adds is the law that binds either of them to the target.

## How It Works

An **edit beat** is a set of concurrent tweens at ONE timeline label: `tl.addLabel("edit1", …)`, then the **readout tween** (numeric proxy + `onUpdate` writing `textContent` only) and the **target transform tween** (`rotation` / `x` / `y` / `scale` to the same endpoint), both placed at the label with the same **duration** and **ease**. The two motions are two projections of one gesture — value at 40% ⇒ target at 40%, on every frame, under any seek. That mathematical lockstep reads as "the panel is editing the page," not "two animations happen to overlap."

For **discrete edits** (per-keystroke retypes, dropdown picks, unit snaps) the couple steps instead of glides: a single threshold state array carries BOTH sides — each state holds the readout text AND the target's property value — and one driver applies whichever state is active. Both sides read from the same state object, so they cannot desync.

Chain 2–4 edit beats with short holds between, and end on a **landed** edit — the last value applied and holding, never a tooltip with the dropdown unopened.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Bipartite by construction: target surface + inspector panel share the frame.
     Every scrubbed readout gets `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` and a fixed
     min-width (≥ the longest value) or the panel edge jitters as digits change. -->
<div class="target-surface">
  <div class="target-button" id="target-button">{buttonLabel}</div>

  </div>
  <div class="field-row">

  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// ---- Continuous couple: ONE label; both tweens share duration AND ease ----
tl.addLabel("edit1", EDIT1_AT);
const rotState = { v: 0 };
const rotReadout = document.getElementById("rotation-readout");

  },
  "edit1",
);
tl.to(
  "#target-button",
  { rotation: ROT_TARGET, duration: SCRUB_DUR, ease: SCRUB_EASE },
  "edit1", // same label — the mirror answers in the same frame
);

// ---- Discrete couple: ONE state array carries BOTH sides ----
const STEPS = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "text-1xl", scale: 1.0 }, // must equal the initial state
  { t: 0.4, text: "text-4xl", scale: 1.9 },
  { t: 1.0, text: "text-xl", scale: 0.85 }, // backspace
  { t: 1.35, text: "text-2xl", scale: 1.3 }, // lands
];
const stepAt = (time) => [...STEPS].reverse().find((s) => time >= s.t) ?? STEPS[0];

tl.addLabel("edit3", EDIT3_AT);
const classReadout = document.getElementById("class-readout");
const stepDriver = { t: 0 };
let lastStep = null;
tl.to(
  stepDriver,
  {
    t: STEPS_TOTAL,
    duration: STEPS_TOTAL,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const s = stepAt(stepDriver.t);
      if (s !== lastStep) {
        classReadout.textContent = s.text; // control steps
        gsap.set(".preview-icon", { scale: s.scale }); // target steps — same state object
        lastStep = s;
      }
    },
  },
  "edit3",
);
```

## Variations

- **Dropdown pick → instant conversion (self-conversion)** — the pick converts the panel's own readout in place (`tl.set("#padding-readout", { textContent: "6 px" }, "pick")`); control and target collapse into one element. Compose the dropdown from neighbors: menu pops via [spring-pop-entrance.md](spring-pop-entrance.md), row hover-stepping via [dynamic-content-sequencing.md](dynamic-content-sequencing.md). The conversion must be an INSTANT snap — tweening between unit strings reads as broken, and instantness is the feature being sold.
- **Easing-handle drag → target re-animates (deferred mirror)** — the edit authors a _behavior_, so the mirror is a **replay**, not a concurrent transform: beat 1 drags the handle (handle tween + coords readout), then at a later label the target performs its motion with the newly-authored curve (`tl.fromTo("#toggle-knob", { x: 0 }, { x: KNOB_TRAVEL, duration: REPLAY_DUR, ease: AUTHORED_EASE }, "replay")`), often under a zoom-out ([viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md)). The one sanctioned case where the response is not in the gesture's beat; the replay must still be unmistakably the edited parameter.
- **Read-sync mirror (reverse direction)** — the gesture happens ON the target (hovering swatches, selecting an element) and the PANEL readout is the bound side. Same discrete contract — one state array of `{ t, hoverTarget, readout }` drives both the highlight and the text.
- **Color couple** — the readout counts (`0 → 80`) while the target's `backgroundColor` tweens between two palette stops at the same label. Keep it two fixed stops (GSAP interpolates); never derive per-frame hex strings by hand.

## Critical Constraints

- **One label, one gesture** — readout tween and target tween share position, duration, AND ease; never sequence readout-then-target, and never stagger the target behind the readout even by 0.1 s — a delayed response reads as an animation following an edit, not a bound surface. A mismatched ease desyncs the mirror mid-tween even when endpoints agree.
- **Discrete steps share one state object** — both sides read the same array entry, so desync is impossible by construction; first entry mirrors the initial DOM state.
- **The readout is data** — no overshoot, no bounce on the settle; the target may carry the gesture's ease but lands exactly on the edited value.
- **Co-visibility is load-bearing** — control and target share the frame for every edit beat; a camera move must never crop the mirror out (punch-and-return around the beats, not through them).
- **`tabular-nums` + fixed `min-width`** on every scrubbed readout; `onUpdate` is O(1) — text writes only, discrete drivers guard writes with a last-state check.
- **End on a landed edit** — the final beat resolves with the value applied and holding (or the deferred-mirror replay); never mid-gesture or on an unopened menu.
- **The gesture's actor is a separate rule** — cursor glide, grab-cursor flip, and click feedback come from the cursor rules; this rule owns only the couple.
